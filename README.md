What is it?
==============

FileBrowserView is a powerful drop-in view for file/folder browsing. Using it is as simple as adding the view to your fragment/activity and running your app. Note that the library is currently in active development (alpha) and is not yet fully functional. 

Contributions, feature requests and bug reports are welcome. 

Features (under development)
=============================

* Customizable interface
* Built-in support for copy/cut/paste/delete/move operations
* Can be used in Fragments, Activities, and DialogFragments
* Tabs to quickly switch between multiple folder locations
* More features coming soon!
